title: "Row IDs"
---

This section explains how the grid assigns row IDs and shows how applications can supply custom row IDs.  

Each grid row has a unique row ID which is used by the grid to identify rows, e.g. for identifying what 
rows are currently selected. These row IDs can be [Grid Assigned](/row-ids/#grid-assigned-ids) or 
[Application Assigned](/row-ids/#application-assigned-ids).   


## Grid Assigned IDs

Row IDs are generated by the grid when data is supplied to the grid. The grid uses a sequence starting at 0 and 
incrementing by 1 to assign row IDs, so for example if there are three rows they will have IDs of `0`, `1` and `2`. 
The row ID does not change for a row once it is set.

If the row data is updated to a new set, the grid will continue with its sequence. For example if 10 rows are initially 
set, IDs [0..9] are used. Then, if the data is set again for another 10 rows, IDs [10..19] are used. This is true even if 
the second set of rows are logically identical to the first set of rows (i.e. it's a refresh operation).

When [Row Grouping](/grouping/) another zero based sequence is used and prefixed with `row-group-`. For example Row Groups
will have IDs `row-group-0`, `row-group-1` and `row-group-2`.

## Application Assigned IDs

When the Application assigns Row IDs, this provides a common Row ID across the grid and the Application. This has advantages such as:

1. The grid API `getRowNode(id)` can be called with the Application known ID (eg `employeeId`) to get the Row Node for a particular piece of data.
1. When updating Row Data (either by updating the `rowData` attribute, or using [Update Transactions](/data-update-transactions/)), the grid uses the Row ID to map old vs new data (e.g. it can work out which Rows to add / remove / update rather than doing a blanket replacement of old vs new data). This allows the grid to keep state such as Row Selection.

Setting Row IDs is done using the `getRowId()` grid callback:

When the row data contains a unique row identifier, such as a Database Primary Key, `getRowId()` can be implemented as follows: 

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    // assumes each data item provided by the application has the ID stored in an attribute called id
    getRowId: params => params.data.id
}
</snippet>

The example below has `getRowId()` implemented to return `params.data.id`. The Row ID is displayed inside the first Column.
