 * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * To include a sync validator (or an array of sync validators) with the control,
 * pass it in as the second argument. Async validators are also supported, but
 * have to be passed in separately as the third arg.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''
