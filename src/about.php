            <h2>
                Our Mission:
            </h2>
            <p>

                At ag-Grid, our mission is simple:

                </p>
                <blockquote>
                <h3>Build the best data grid in the world.
                </h3>
                </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                Born out of frustration with existing solutions, ag-Grid evolved from a side project to becoming the leading JavaScript datagrid on the market. We are a company built by developers for developers, and - true to our roots - we offer ag-Grid Free: an open-source project that delivers world class grid performance. ag-Grid Enterprise is our commercially-licensed offering which has enjoyed widespread adoption and permits us to keep delivering on our mission.
            </p>

            <p>    
                Our story is proof that necessity is the mother of invention. During his time working in London-based financial institutions, Niall Crosby - founder and CEO - struggled to find any datagrid component that could deliver the performance required in tandem with a complete feature list. This struggle ultimately led Niall to pulling out the keyboard one Christmas holiday period and starting ag-Grid as a side project. This was then released as open source and quickly developed a following. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Niall found himself having to devote considerable time and effort to maintaining ag-Grid, even fielding feature requests from users. It became apparent that this thing had legs - and the idea of ag-Grid Enterprise took seed in Niall’s mind. Fast forward to March 2016 and the first commercial version was launched.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, ag-Grid is a self-funded, bootstrapped company with over 500 customers in 49 countries. Our product has resonated in the market - as our users face the same challenges Niall did - and this has been central to our rapid growth. And we’re not stopping here: we are furiously working on the next great features to continue our mission.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Our Principles:
            </h2>
            <p>
                We believe that a datagrid should be agnostic to the framework that developers choose. This allows flexibility and future-proofs your development. This is also where the 'ag' in ag-Grid comes from.
            </p>

            <p>    
                Our experience is in building Enterprise applications: we know that the datagrid is at the core of an Enterprise application, and needs to deliver performance and a rich feature set. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We give away what others charge for - ag-Grid Free provides all of the features of our competion. We only charge when we go above and beyond, with features that other grids don’t provide.
