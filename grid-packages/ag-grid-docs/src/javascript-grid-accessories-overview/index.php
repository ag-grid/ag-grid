    <h1>Grid Accessories Overview</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        The grid provides many additional functions beyond the simple display of rows and columns.
        Some of these additional functions require UI that are provided in or around the grid.
        These additional UI pieces are known as Grid Accessories.
