Doing releases:

Update the license manager, to next version.

ag-Grid

+ Major release?  Update LicenseManager with new timestamp
+ Update version in bower.json
+ Update version in package.json
+ Run 'gulp release'
+ Make sure any new files in 'dist' are added to Git
+ Note: its a good idea to exclude node_modules at this stage
+ Also worth synchornizing the ag-grid folder
+ Commit all changes to Github (including built files in /dist)
+ Release in Github
+ Push to by running 'npm publish ./'

Now if a new major version, go update and release:
ag-grid-enterprise, ag-grid-react, ag-grid-angular, ag-grid-react-example, ag-grid-angular-example, ag-grid-commonjs-example
