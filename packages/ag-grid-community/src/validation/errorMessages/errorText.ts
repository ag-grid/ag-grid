/**
 * NOTES on setting console messages:
 * 1. The message is a function that returns either a string or an array of any type.
 * 2. Returning an array enables the console to log actual objects / numbers / booleans nicely as this will be spread to the underlying console call instead of being cast to a string.
 * 3. Each entry should be followed by as const so that the IDE hover shows the actual message to aid devs
