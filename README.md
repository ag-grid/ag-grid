Angular Grid is a powerful data grid for AngularJS. Until now, there was no decent grid written for AngularJS.

Angular Grid was built for financial reporting applications. It supports large data sets with filtering, grouping and aggregating. It's customizable look and feel creates professional presentations.

Easy to use, quick to get going.

#### Install with Bower
```sh
$ bower install ag-grid
```

#### Install with Npm
```sh
$ npm install angular-grid
```

Handling Large Data Sets
==============

The grid engine uses AngularJS where required and native Javascript at all other times, giving the best performance. A grid written solely in AngularJS will be inherently slower.

Row Virtualisation provides a window on top of the data, rendering only DOM objects visible within the viewable area. This makes displaying hundreds of thousands of rows within the browser a reality, allowing the user to filter and group to the data of interest.
