Contributing
==============

ag-Grid is not looking for contributors. It is not intended to be developed by an online community.
However suggestion on change and raising bugs are appreciated.

If you are doing a Pull Request:
- Make your code changes in `src/` files only, don't update dist files
- Discard all changes to `dist/`
- Create Pull Request

For large changes:
- Make your doc changes in project [ag-grid-docs](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-docs), a feature is not complete unless it's documented!
- Do manual end to end testing off all examples in documentation

PR's on new features **are not** generally accepted. 

PR's on small bug fixes **are** generally accepted.

If a PR for a large request is submitted, the typical action is the author will take influence from the
code to implement the feature, either in ag-grid or [ag-grid-enterprise](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-enterprise).
