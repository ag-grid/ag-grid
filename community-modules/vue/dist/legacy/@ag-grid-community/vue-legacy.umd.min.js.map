It is\n * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n * your questions.\n *\n * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n *\n * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n *\n *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n *\n * So what to do?  The is the best:\n *\n *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n *\n * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n *\n *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n *\n * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n * linear speed or acceleration.\n *\n * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n *\n *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n *\n *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n *     pixels!\n *\n *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n *\n * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n *\n *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n *\n *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n *\n *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n *     you know.\n *\n * Implementation info:\n *\n * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n * average mouse:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *\n * On the trackpad:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *\n * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n * also missing delta values.\n *\n * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n *\n * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n *\n * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n * better normalize spin speed.
