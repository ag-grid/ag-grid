It is\n     * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n     * your questions.\n     *\n     * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n     * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n     *\n     * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n     *\n     *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n     *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n     *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n     *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n     *\n     * So what to do?  The is the best:\n     *\n     *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n     *\n     * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n     * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n     *\n     *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n     *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n     *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n     *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n     *\n     * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n     * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n     * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n     * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n     * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n     * linear speed or acceleration.\n     *\n     * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n     *\n     *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n     *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n     *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n     *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n     *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n     *\n     *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n     *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n     *     pixels!\n     *\n     *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n     *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n     *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n     *\n     * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n     *\n     *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n     *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n     *\n     *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n     *\n     *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n     *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n     *     you know.\n     *\n     * Implementation info:\n     *\n     * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n     * average mouse:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *\n     * On the trackpad:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *\n     * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n     * also missing delta values.\n     *\n     * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n     *\n     * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n     *\n     * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n     * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n     * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n     * better normalize spin speed.

Not autowiring all the cells gives performance improvement. */\nvar Beans = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function Beans() {\n    }\n    Beans.prototype.registerGridComp = function (gridPanel) {\n        this.gridPanel = gridPanel;\n    };\n    Beans.prototype.postConstruct = function () {\n        this.doingMasterDetail = this.gridOptionsWrapper.isMasterDetail();\n    };\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('paginationProxy')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"paginationProxy\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('context')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"context\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('columnApi')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"columnApi\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('gridApi')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"gridApi\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('gridOptionsWrapper')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"gridOptionsWrapper\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('expressionService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"expressionService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('rowRenderer')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"rowRenderer\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('$compile')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"$compile\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('templateService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"templateService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('valueService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"valueService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('eventService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"eventService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('columnController')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"columnController\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('columnAnimationService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"columnAnimationService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Optional('rangeController')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"rangeController\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('focusController')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"focusController\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Optional('contextMenuFactory')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"contextMenuFactory\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('cellRendererFactory')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"cellRendererFactory\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('popupService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"popupService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('valueFormatterService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"valueFormatterService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('stylingService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"stylingService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('columnHoverService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"columnHoverService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('userComponentFactory')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"userComponentFactory\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('animationFrameService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"taskQueue\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('dragAndDropService')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"dragAndDropService\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('sortController')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"sortController\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('filterManager')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"filterManager\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('maxDivHeightScaler')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"maxDivHeightScaler\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('tooltipManager')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"tooltipManager\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('frameworkOverrides')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"frameworkOverrides\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('detailRowCompCache')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"detailRowCompCache\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('cellPositionUtils')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"cellPositionUtils\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('rowPositionUtils')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"rowPositionUtils\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        Autowired('selectionController')\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"selectionController\", void 0);\n    __decorate([\n        PostConstruct\n    ], Beans.prototype, \"postConstruct\", null);\n    Beans = __decorate([\n        Bean('beans')\n    ], Beans);\n    return Beans;\n}());\nexport { Beans };\n","/**\n * @ag-grid-community/core - Advanced Data Grid / Data Table supporting Javascript / React / AngularJS / Web Components\n * @version v23.0.0\n * @link http://www.ag-grid.com/\n * @license MIT\n */\nvar __decorate = (this && this.__decorate) || function (decorators, target, key, desc) {\n    var c = arguments.length, r = c < 3 ?
