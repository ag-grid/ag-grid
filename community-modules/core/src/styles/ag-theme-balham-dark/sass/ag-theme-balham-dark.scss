// LEGACY THEME FILE
// This mixin is for backwards compatibility with older apps that use global variables.
// Including this file emits CSS for the Balham Dark theme. New apps should @import ag-theme-balham-dark-mixin.scss
// and @include ag-theme-balham-dark($params), instead of using this file.
