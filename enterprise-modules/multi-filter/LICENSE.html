    <ul><p>1.2 Interpretation</p>

        <p>In these Terms (including the introduction and schedules) unless the
            context otherwise requires:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a limited
            company) as well as a natural person;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) reference to these Terms includes the schedules and appendices and other
            documents attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as
            amended, added to or replaced from time to time);</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) references to clauses or schedules shall be to those in or to these
            Terms and references to paragraphs shall be to paragraphs of the
            schedules or annexes to the schedules (as the case may be);</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(d) clause headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
            construction of these Terms;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(e) reference to "<strong>including</strong>" or any similar terms in these Terms shall
            be treated as being by way of example and shall not limit the general
            applicability of any preceding words; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(f) reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended,
            extended or re-enacted from time to time and to any subordinate
            provision made under that legislation.</p></ul>
    </ul>

    <li value="2"><p><strong>Provision of Licensed Materials and Support Services</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>2.1 The Licensor shall make the Licensed Materials available in Source Code
        form (along with any login details and an activation key required to
        use the Licensed Materials), following payment of the Licence Fees.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.2 Subject to clause 2.3 the Licensor grants to the Licensee and its
        Affiliate(s) a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence, commencing on the Effective
        Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Licensed Materials in
        accordance with the terms of these Terms, subject to the limit on the
        number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the Order. Members
        within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative
        members as long as the number of Licensee Developers at any time does
        not exceed the limit set out in the Order as the "Number of Licensee
        Developers". For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying
        JavaScript Code as part of the creation of an Application or
        Modification shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For
        example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript on
        an Application, but only two developers directly working with the
        Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.3 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if the Order specifies
        that this is a Deployment Licence then:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) the licence granted in clause 2.2 shall be sub-licensable and subject to
            the limit on the number of permitted Production Environment(s) set out
            in the Order;</p><p></p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) subject to this clause 2.3 and clause 2.4(b), the Deployment Licence
            shall be subject to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out
            in these Terms; and</p><p></p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall ensure that the terms of any
            sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the same as the terms
            of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to
            sub-licence its rights).</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>2.4 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may use the Licensed Materials to
        install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the
        Licensed Materials for production, test, archival, emergency re-start
        and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative
        works from the Licensed Materials in the form of Applications, provided
        that:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may not create more than one
            Application if a single application developer license is specified on
            the Order (provided that new versions and different editions of an
            Application shall be considered, for the purposes of the number of
            permitted Applications, to be the same as the original Application as
            long as they are in the same evolutionary line). For the avoidance of
            doubt, Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may create an unlimited number of
            Applications if a multiple applications developer license is specified
            on the Order;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) unless the Order specifies that this is a Deployment Licence, any
            Application created must be used for the Licensee's internal business
            purposes only and must not be licensed to third parties; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not permit any end user of any
            Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any
            applications other than, the Application being used by that end user.</p></ul>

        <p>Any reference in this clause 2 to "use" of the Licensed Materials shall
            be deemed to include any and all of the foregoing.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall be permitted to create
        Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee's use
        of the Software in accordance with these Terms. In the event that the
        Licensee creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software,
        the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in
        relation to any such Modification(s) from the date on which any such
        Modification(s) take place.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.6 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not change or remove the
        copyright notice from any of the files included in the Licensed
        Materials.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>2.7 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not redistribute the Licensed
        Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by
        these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall not
        redistribute the Licensed Materials or any Modifications:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) other than by including the Software or a portion of the Software within
            Application(s); and</p></ul><p></p>

        <ul><p>(b) as part of any Application that can be described as a development
            toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user
            interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by
            software, application, or website developers or designers, or has a
            similar purpose or functionality (as determined by the Licensor).</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>2.8 Subject to clause 2.5, the Licensor will provide the Support Services in
        accordance with schedule 1 from the Effective Date.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Price of Licensed Materials and payment</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>3.1 The Licence Fees payable will be as set out on the Site at the time the
        Licensee submits its Order. Payment of the Licence Fees is in advance
        and must be made by credit or debit card on the checkout page on the
        Site. The Licensor accepts payment by most major credit and debit cards.
        Payment for the Licence Fees will be automatically taken from the
        Licensee's selected payment method.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>3.2 Prices for the Licensed Materials may change from time to time, but
        changes will not affect any Order the Licensee has placed and paid for.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>3.3 Unless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all amounts referred
        to in these Terms are exclusive of value added tax ("<strong>VAT</strong>") which,
        where chargeable by the Licensor, shall be payable by the Licensee at
        the rate and in the manner prescribed by law. All other taxes, duties,
        customs or similar charges shall be the responsibility of the Licensor.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Warranties</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>4.1 The Licensor represents and warrants that:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to license the Licensed
            Materials and provide the Support Services (if any) as contemplated by
            these Terms;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) the Support Services (if any) shall be performed with reasonable care,
            skill and diligence;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensed Materials and Support Services (if any) shall comply with
            all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and
            codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in
            force; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(d) the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the
            Documentation for a period of 90 days after the Effective Date, provided
            that this warranty shall not apply to error or failure resulting from
            (i) machine error; (ii) the Licensee's failure to follow operating
            instructions; (iii) negligence or accident; or (iv) modifications to the
            Software by any person or entity other than the Licensor.</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>4.2 The Licensee represents and warrants that:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to perform its
            obligations as contemplated by these Terms; and</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(b) in the performance of its obligations under these Terms, it shall comply
            with (and shall procure that its Affiliate(s) shall comply with) all
            applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes
            of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force.</p></ul></ul>

    <ul><p>4.3 The Licensor does not warrant that the operation of the Licensed
        Materials or the code produced by the Software will be uninterrupted or
        error-free. The Licensor provides the Licensed Materials on an "as is"
        basis and all warranties not expressly set out in these Terms, including
        any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness
        for a particular purpose, are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted
        by law.</p></ul>

    <ul><p>4.4 The Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty in
        clause 4.1(d) shall be to require the Licensor to repair the affected
        portion of the Software to ensure that it complies with the
        Documentation.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>5.1 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensor Materials and Licensed

        Terms, a limited, non-transferable, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence
        to use the Licensee Materials only for the purpose of carrying out its

        Intellectual Property Rights in any Application or Modification created
        by the Licensee (or any of its Affiliate(s)) will be deemed to transfer
        to the Licensor under these Terms.</p></ul>

        technical information, inventions, ideas or techniques of whatever
        nature utilised or gained by such party in the course of performing its
        obligations under these Terms ("<strong>Know-how</strong>"), for its own benefit or

        and/or Support Services by the Licensee infringes the Intellectual
        Property Rights or other proprietary rights of any third party, provided

        <ul><p>(a) the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing as soon as reasonably
            practicable of any claim under clause 6.2 of which the Licensee has

        <ul><p>(b) the Licensee does not admit any liability or agree to any settlement or
            compromise of an Indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of
            the Licensor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(c) the Licensor shall, at any time from notification in accordance with
            clause 6.2(a), at the Licensor's request, cost and expense, be entitled

        and/or Support Services is restricted as a result of any claim for which
        the Licensor is obliged to indemnify under clause 6.2, the Licensor may,
        at its discretion, either procure the rights necessary for continued
        receipt, possession and use or promptly carry out such modification or
        replacement as may be necessary to make receipt, possession and use
        non-infringing.</p></ul>

        <p>however arising (whether from breach of contract, tort (including
            negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise), whether or not such
            loss was foreseeable or if the party which would otherwise be liable for
            such loss was advised of its possibility (and, for the purposes of this
            clause 7.2, the term "loss" includes a partial loss or reduction in
            value as well as a complete or total loss).</p></ul>

    <ul><p>7.3 Subject to clauses 7.1 and 7.2, the Licensor's total liability arising

        The total liability of the Licensor for any specific event will not

    <ul><p>8.2 Either party may disclose the other's Confidential Information to the
        extent required by law or by any court, tribunal, regulator or other
        authority with competent jurisdiction to order its disclosure (but only
        to the extent of such requirement), provided that, to the extent

        personal data processed pursuant to these Terms (including the subject
        matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing and the
        categories of data subject) are as described in schedule 2. In relation
        to all personal data provided or made available to the Licensor by or on

            <ul><p>(i) the protection of the rights of the relevant data subjects; and</p></ul>

            <ul><p>(ii) a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by any
                processing of such personal data, in particular protection from
                accidental loss or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
                disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or

        <ul><p>(f) shall not engage any sub-processor without the prior written consent of

            the Licensor and the sub-processor which imposes on the sub-processor
            terms equivalent to the provisions of this clause 9. The Licensor shall
            be responsible for the management of any permitted sub-processor and its
            compliance with such terms and shall be directly liable to the Licensee
            for any breach of the same;</p></ul>

        <ul><p>(g) shall notify the Licensee without undue delay of any breach of the

                Licensor receives;</p></ul>

            <ul><p>(ii) the Licensee's obligations set out under Articles 32 - 36 of the GDPR
                to:</p>

                <ul><p>(A) ensure the security of the processing;</p></ul>

                <ul><p>(B) notify the relevant supervisory authority and any data subjects, where

                <ul><p>(C) carry out any data protection impact assessments ("<strong>DPIA</strong>") on the
                    impact of the processing on the protection of personal data; and</p></ul>

                <ul><p>(D) consult the relevant supervisory authority prior to any processing where

        <ul><p>(i) shall make available to the Licensee all information reasonably required
            by the Licensee to demonstrate the Licensor's compliance with its

            another auditor mandated by the Licensee.</p></ul></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Term</strong></p></li>

    These Terms shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless
    sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, continue for an initial
    term of 12 months ("<strong>Initial Term</strong>"), when it shall terminate
    automatically without notice unless, no later than 1 month before the
    end of the Initial Term (or any Extended Term agreed under this clause),
    the parties agree in writing that the term of these Terms shall be
    extended for a period of 12 months (each an "<strong>Extended Term</strong>"). Unless
    it is further extended under this clause 10 or terminated earlier in
    accordance with these Terms, these Terms shall terminate automatically

        <ul><p>(b) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is possible
            to remedy that breach, but the other fails to do so within 30 days of

            under clause 13 for a period of 30 days or more.</p></ul>

        <p>For the purposes of this clause 11.1, in order for it to be possible to
            remedy a breach it must be possible to take steps so as to put the other
            party into the same position which (save as to the date) it would have
            been in if the breach had never occurred.</p></ul>

    <li><p><strong>Consequences of termination</strong></p></li>

    <ul><p>12.1 Termination of these Terms for any reason will not affect:</p>

        <ul><p>(a) any accrued rights or liabilities which either party may have by the

            provisions that expressly or by implication are intended to come into

            the foregoing, clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14 shall survive
            termination of these Terms.</p></ul></ul>
