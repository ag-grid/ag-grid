                        JavaScript code as part of the creation or Modification of an Application's user interface,
                        which user interface creation or Modification uses the Software shall constitute a separate
                        Licensee Developer. For example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript
                        code with respect to the creation or Modification of the user interface of an Application and
                        such creation or Modification uses the Software, but only two developers are directly working
                        with the Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.
