Install AG Grid with a package manager or download AG Grid directly.

## Install AG Grid with NPM

AG Grid is available through NPM packages. Below is a code example of using AG Grid with NPM and ECMA 6 imports.

To install AG Grid and update your `package.json` file run:

```bash
npm install --save ag-grid-community
```

To install AG Grid Enterprise and update your `package.json` file run:

```bash
npm install --save ag-grid-enterprise
```

Afterwards, depending on your project setup, you can either `require` or `import` the module. For ag-grid, you need the ag-grid module:

```js
// ECMA 5 - using nodes require() method
var AgGrid = require('ag-grid-community');

// ECMA 6 - using the system import method
import { createGrid } from 'ag-grid-community';
```

For AG Grid Enterprise features, import the `ag-grid-enterprise` package for it to be included in your application:

```js
import 'ag-grid-enterprise'
```

After you have loaded the scripts, you should include the styles in your project. There are several
ways to do it, depending on your module bundler and the specifics of your project. The stylesheet
files reside in `styles/` directory of the ag-grid package - you should include `ag-grid.css`
and the theme of your choice.

## Download AG Grid

If your project does not use package manager and you don't want to refer AG Grid from CDN,
you can download the AG Grid's source files and keep them in your project structure.

**Disclaimer:** This makes upgrading more complex and prone to errors. We recommend using AG Grid
from an NPM package or from CDN.
