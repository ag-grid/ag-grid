title: "Row Grouping - Unbalanced Groups"

This section covers Unbalanced Groups - when grouping by rows that can contain `null` or `undefined` group values.

## Handling Unbalanced Groups

By default, unbalanced rows (rows containing `null`, `undefined` or empty values for the column that is being grouped) get grouped together as `(Blanks)`. To instead have the nodes remain ungrouped, you can enable the `groupAllowUnbalanced` grid option. We refer to this scenario as **Unbalanced Groups** in that there is a mix of groups and rows as siblings.

The following example demonstrates:

* The `groupAllowUnbalanced` grid option has been set to `true`.
* Data is grouped by column 'State'. Rows are either grouped by state 'New York', 'California' or not grouped.
* Removing the grouping shows that the non grouped rows have no 'State' value.

## Balanced Groups

When not using unbalanced groups, the grid will, by default, create a (Blanks) group and populate it with any rows without a valid group value. The following example demonstrates this default behaviour:

{% gridExampleRunner title="Balanced Groups" name="balanced-groups"  exampleHeight=570 /%}
