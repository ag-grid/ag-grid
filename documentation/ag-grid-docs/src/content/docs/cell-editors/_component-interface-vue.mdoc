{% if isFramework("vue") %}

When a Vue component is instantiated the grid will make the grid APIs, a number of utility methods as well as the cell and
row values available to you via a `params` object.

You can access the `params` object via `this.params` in the usual methods (lifecycle hooks, methods etc), and via `props.params` when using `setup`.

The editor `params` interface is as follows:

{% /if %}
