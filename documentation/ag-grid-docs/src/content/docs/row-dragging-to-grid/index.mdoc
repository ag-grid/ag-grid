title: "Row Dragging Between Grids"
---

Row Drag Between Grids is concerned with seamless integration among different grids, allowing records to be dragged from one grid and dropped at a specific index on another grid.

{% apiDocumentation source="grid-api/api.json" section="rowDrag" names=["addRowDropZone", "removeRowDropZone", "getRowDropZoneParams"] /%}

## Adding a Grid as Target

To allow adding a grid as DropZone, the `getRowDropZoneParams` API method should be used in the target grid and the `addRowDropZone` in the source grid.

```js
const dropZoneParams = targetGridApi.getRowDropZoneParams({
    onDragStop: function() {
        alert('Record Dropped!');
    }
});

sourceGridApi.addRowDropZone(dropZoneParams);

// when the DropZone above is no longer needed
sourceGridApi.removeRowDropZone(dropZoneParams);
```

In the example below, note the following:

* When you drag from one grid to another, a line will appear indicating where the row will be placed.

* Rows can be dragged from one grid to the other grid. When the row is received, it is **not** removed from the first grid. This is the choice of the example. The example could equally have removed from the other grid.

* Rows can be removed from both grids by dragging the row to the 'Trash' drop zone.

* New rows can be created by clicking on the red, green and blue buttons.

## Dragging Multiple Records Between Grids

It is possible to drag multiple records at once from one grid to another.

In the example below, note the following:

* This example allows for `rowDragMultiRow`, between grids. For more info on `multiRowDrag` within the grid see the [Multi-Row Dragging](./row-dragging/#multi-row-dragging) section in the Row Dragging documentation.

* When `Remove Source Rows` is selected, the rows will be removed from the **Athletes** grid once they are dropped onto the **Selected Athletes** grid.

* If `Only Deselect Source Rows` is selected, all selected rows that were copied will be deselected but will not be removed.{% br /%} Note: If some rows are selected and a row that isn't selected is copied, the selected rows will remain selected.

* If `None` is selected, the rows will be copied from one grid to another and the source grid will stay as is.
